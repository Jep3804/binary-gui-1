# binary-gui-1



This is the first time I have used the tkinter library to implement the GUI. The interface consists of four buttons:

1. Binary to Decimal
2. Decimal to Binary
3. Ones' Complement of Binary String
4. Two's Complement of Binary String

Clicking each button would take you to a converter, which consists of a textbox in which you can type either a binary string (consisting of only zeroes and ones) or a positive integer. Below the textbox is a ```go back``` button which will take you back to the main menu.



To run and open the app:
      1. Make sure you have python3 installed
      2. type ```python3 main.py``` to run the executable

      
Feel free to play around with the GUI and the code

Enjoy!
